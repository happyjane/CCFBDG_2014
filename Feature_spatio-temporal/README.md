Feature extraction 
==========================================================================
We analyse the features of the events from time and space

From the perspective of time  we extract these features :
1.Time reports focus length of events:news_duration.py
2.Holiday events related characteristics: news_holiday. py
3.Week related characteristics:week. Py
4.The first ant last reports time of event:event_time. py

From the perspective of space  we extract these features :
1.Extract states info :__init__.py extract_location.py  main.py
2.space feature extraction:dealdata.sql feature_extr.sql
At last,We collect all the spatio-temporal features  in 
event_attributes.txt (sample)
